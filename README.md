**Portfolio Website Overview**  
Your portfolio website is a clean and focused showcase of your work and professional profile. It features two key sections:  

1. **Index Page**:  
   - The homepage provides a visually appealing introduction to your skills, projects, and personal branding.  
   - Includes a clear and structured layout, with sections such as an "About Me," a featured projects gallery, and possibly testimonials or career highlights.  
   - Navigation is intuitive, with links to other parts of the site, such as the contact form.  

2. **Contact Form Page**:  
   - A dedicated page to allow visitors or potential clients to get in touch with you.  
   - Features an elegant, user-friendly form where visitors can provide their name, email address, and message.  
   - May include social media links, an email address, or a phone number for additional contact options.

This minimalistic design focuses on simplicity and usability while highlighting your strengths effectively.
